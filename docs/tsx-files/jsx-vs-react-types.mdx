You may have seen types like `JSX.Element` and `React.ReactElement` used interchangeably in React apps.

The Facebook team made JSX at the time they made React. JSX is a JavaScript language extension that adds support for writing markup (HTML) in JavaScript. Although React makes heavy use of JSX, the two are independent. In fact, there are other frameworks that use JSX as well like [Stencil], [Solid], and [Vue].

TypeScript made the decision to provide first-class support for JSX and created a rich set of types to describe JSX. These live in a global `JSX` namespace. (Think every DOM element and attribute)

That is where the JSX types comes from.

React ships their own types in the [@types/react] package. These types wrap the JSX types with some React-specific things.

For instance, if you are using `JSX.Element` in a React project, then you are really using `React.ReactElement` under the hood.

From the React Types:

```ts
declare global {
    namespace JSX {
        interface Element extends React.ReactElement<any, any> { }
        interface ElementClass extends React.Component<any> {
            render(): React.ReactNode;
        }
        // ...
```

So, which one should you use? It probably doesn't matter, but the React types might be a better choice for the following reasons:

- JSX types don't support React specific things like Hooks so you would have to mix/match
- There seems to be more information about the React types
- It's not always clear how the JSX and React types are being used together
