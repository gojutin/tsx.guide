All of the types needed for React and React DOM are found in the
[@types/react]
and [@types/react-dom] npm modules respectively.
Both of these libraries should be included as dev dependencies for all of your React/TypeScript projects.

```sh
yarn add --dev @types/react @types/react-dom
```

Once you import the type definitions, React and React DOM will expose all of the available types as named exports.

```ts
import React, { FC, HTMLAttributes } from "react";
import ReactDOM, { Renderer } from "react-dom";
// You could also use them without destructuring -
// React.FC or ReactDOM.Renderer
```
