The `useCallback` hook is used by passing a callback that will be memoized. The arguments of the callback that you provide can be annotated as normal.
All arguments that are not explicitly typed will be cast as `any`.

If your callback returns a value, you don't usually need to explicitly set the return type as this can usually be inferred.

```tsx
const update = useCallback(arg => {
  // arg is of type "any"
  console.log(arg);
}, []);

const update = useCallback((arg: string) => {
  // arg is of type "string"
  console.log(arg);
}, []);
```
