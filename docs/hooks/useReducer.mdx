It's possible to get full type safety with the `useReducer` hook, including an exhaustive check to ensure that the `reducer` handles every possible case.

Start by defining the type definition for the state and action. The action type is defining using a [Discriminated Union]:

```tsx
type State = {
  loading: boolean;
  value: number;
};

type Action =
  | { type: "SET_LOADING"; payload: boolean }
  | { type: "SET_VALUE"; payload: number };
```

When defining the `reducer` function, it is important to explicitly set the argument types and return type of the function:

```tsx {1}
function reducer(state: State, action: Action): State {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "SET_LOADING":
      return {
        ...state,
        loading: action.payload
      };
    case "SET_VALUE":
      return {
        ...state,
        value: action.payload
      };
    default: {
      return state;
    }
  }
```

Now, all together:

```tsx
type State = {
  loading: boolean;
  value: number;
};

type Action =
  | { type: "SET_LOADING"; payload: boolean }
  | { type: "SET_VALUE"; payload: number };

function reducer(state: State, action: Action): State {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "SET_LOADING":
      return {
        ...state,
        loading: action.payload
      };
    case "SET_VALUE":
      return {
        ...state,
        value: action.payload
      };
    default: {
      return state;
    }
  }
}
```

Now there is full type safety for the state and actions in the `reducer` function.

## Exhautive Check

The above example provides much of the type safety, but it doesn't catch unhandled cases. For instance, this would not result in an error even though the `SET_VALUE` action was not handled:

```tsx
type State = {
  loading: boolean;
  value: number;
};

type Action =
  | { type: "SET_LOADING"; payload: boolean }
  | { type: "SET_VALUE"; payload: number };

function reducer(state: State, action: Action): State {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "SET_LOADING":
      return {
        ...state,
        loading: action.payload
      };
    // No case for SET_VALUE
    default: {
      return state;
    }
  }
}
```

This can be fixed with a simple function and change to the default case:

```tsx {23,28-30}
type State = {
  loading: boolean;
  value: number;
};

type Action =
  | { type: "SET_LOADING"; payload: boolean }
  | { type: "SET_VALUE"; payload: number };

function reducer(state: State, action: Action): State {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "SET_LOADING":
      return {
        ...state,
        loading: action.payload
      };
    case "SET_VALUE":
      return {
        ...state,
        value: action.payload
      };
    default: {
      return exhaustiveCheck(state);
    }
  }
}

function exhaustiveCheck(type: never): never {
  throw new Error("Missing type");
}
```

The `exhaustiveCheck` function works like this:

By the time we reach the default case, we expect all of our actions to be handled. Therefore, we can expect that the type of `action.type` would be `never`.

Instead of returning the state in the default case, we run `action.type` through a function that checks that it is of type `never`- the type thatâ€™s left after all other cases have been removed.

If an action type is not handled, the `exhaustiveCheck` function will throw an error because it received the case that was not handled.

You can learn more about exhaustiveness checking in the [TypeScript Docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#exhaustiveness-checking).
