### Inferred Types

The `useState` hook is able to infer the type based on the initial value that you supply.

```tsx {2}
// Pass an empty string as the initial value
const [name, setName] = useState("");

// No Error
setName("Gilfoyle");

// Error
setName(7);
```

In this example above, `name` is inferred as type `string` and the `setName` function will only accept a string as an argument.

### Explicit Types

Sometimes you want to initialize with a null-ish value while still providing type safety for the eventual value.

You can do this by supplying a `union` to the `useState` hook as a `type argument`:

```tsx
type User = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
};

const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null); ðŸ‘ˆ

// Check that user is not null
useEffect(() => {
  if (user) {
    console.log(user.name);
  }
}, [user]);

// assert user as User
useEffect(() => {
  console.log((user as User).name);
}, [user]);
```

Because `user` could be `null`, you will have to do a check that user is not `null` or use an assertion to cast the type.
