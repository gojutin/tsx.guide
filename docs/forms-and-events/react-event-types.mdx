There are several kinds of events in React. You can view the [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html) for more information about each event type.

Most React event types are generics which take a type argument of the element they are targeting:

```ts
React.MouseEvent<HTMLDivElement>;
React.PointerEvent<HTMLSpanElement>;
React.MouseEvent<HTMLDivElement>;
React.KeyboardEvent<HTMLTextAreaElement>;
```

:::tip
If you are unsure of a type, you can hover over the event handler (onChange, onSubmit, etc.) in VSCode to get some helpful hints.

### Change Events

For a ChangeEvent, you will need to provide the HTML type as a type argument to the generic `ChangeEvent` type:

| Component Type | Event Type                               |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Input          | `React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>`    |
| Textarea       | `React.ChangeEvent<HTMLTextAreaElement>` |
| Select         | `React.ChangeEvent<HTMLSelectElement>`   |
