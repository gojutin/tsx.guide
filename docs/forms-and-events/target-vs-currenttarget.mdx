**`currentTarget`** - A reference to the element on which the event listener is registered.

**`target`**- A reference to the element from which the event was originally dispatched. This might be a child element to the element on which the event listener is registered.

This really has nothing to do with TypeScript usage with React, but can be a source of confusion.
In fact, this really have nothing to do with React. `target` and `currentTarget` are part of the DOM Event Object API that React just mimics in JSX.

You may have seen `target` and `currentTarget` used interchangebly in React event handlers:

```tsx {6,10}
function App() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("");
  const [email, setEmail] = useState("");

  function handleSetName(e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) {
    setName(e.target.value);
  }

  function handleSetEmail(e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) {
    setEmail(e.currentTarget.value);
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={e => console.log(e)}>
      <input value={name} onChange={handleSetName} />
      <input value={email} onChange={handleSetEmail} />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

So, which one should you use?

For most common use cases, they can be used interchangebly as they are pointing to the same DOM node.

There are situations where it does matter:

```tsx
function handleClick(e: React.MouseEvent<HTMLDivElement>) {
  // Okay
  console.log(e.currentTarget.classList);
  // Error
  console.log(e.target.classList);
}
```

The good news is that as long as you provide the right type annotations, TypeScript should catch the problems immediately.

Here is a great explanation of the differences between the two: [https://stackoverflow.com/a/5921615](https://stackoverflow.com/a/5921615)
