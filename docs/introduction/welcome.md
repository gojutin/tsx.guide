<Welcome />

**This is a guide and cheatsheet for writing React apps with TypeScript.**

TypeScript and React make a wonderful pair.
Not only does this pairing offer a great developer experience full of rich tooling, but also a major confidence boost in the code that you ship.

But, here is the thing.

React/JSX has a lot of types, and it is not always so clear as to the best way to use them.
This site aims to help navigate you through many of the nuances that you might encounter when writing your React apps with TypeScript.

If you have a thought on how to improve this site, or see anything that doesn't look right, please consider [contributing](contributing).

This project is heavily inspired by the awesome work done on [react-typescript-cheatsheet](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react-typescript-cheatsheet/).
