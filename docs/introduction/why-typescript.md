There are so many benefits that come along with choosing to write your React apps in TypeScript:

- Much more predictable code
- Easier debugging
- Great tools enabled by static types
- The ability to use the newest JavaScript features
- Easier team collaboration
- Near-instant feedback on coding errors
- Self-documenting code
- Autocomplete for props and state
- Strongly typed markup
- No need for things like prop-types and type constants.

Most of these benefits are not unique to React and would apply to any project that uses TypeScript. Since TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, it can be used pretty much anywhere that you can use JavaScript.

And, since JSX is just JavaScript, it is already in a great position to embrace the power of TypeScript. Not only that, TypeScript has first-class support for JSX in the compiler, types included! See [React Types](../getting-started/react-types) for more information on the differences between the JSX types provided by TypeScript vs. React.
