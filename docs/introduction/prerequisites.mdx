### An understanding of React

This is not a guide on how to use React. If you are new to React, the [React Docs] best place to start.

If you are new to both React and TypeScript, it is usually best to start with React without TypeScript. It can be challenging to try to learn them both simultaneously.

### An understanding of TypeScript

If you are new to TypeScript, the [TypeScript Docs] are the best place to start.

The React type definitions can get rather complex, and make heavy use of [generics].
The authors have done an incredible job of making them as simple to use as possible, but there are some things that just can't be avoided:

1. Components can get complex, requiring more verbose types.
2. React/JSX has **a lot** of types. For instance, every DOM element.

Once you have a good understanding of React and TypeScript, this guide will be here to help you through any bumps in the road. ðŸ™‚
