# Contributing

Do you have an idea on how to improve this site or see something that doesn't quite look right? Any contributions to help make this site better are greatly appreciated!

There are two ways that you can help:

1. #### Share your ideas, feedback, or potential errors in a GitHub Issue.
2. #### Change the code yourself.

## File an Issue

If you don't feel like going in and making any changes to the code yourself, you can [submit an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/gojutin/www.tsx.guide/issues).

When you click the `New Issue` button, you will have a choice of templates to use:

- Incorrect/Missing Documentation
- Suggestion for Documentation/Site

## Submit a Pull Request
