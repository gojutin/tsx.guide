:::success TypeScript is awesome!
Static types enable great editor/IDE tools that can help catch bugs in real-time, offer auto-completion/Intellisense, and more. This leads to a much better developer experience, more predictable code, and way less open browser tabs.

#### Other benefits include:

- The ability to use the newest JavaScript features
- Easier team collaboration with established type definitions
- Self-documenting code
- Strongly typed markup
- No need for things like prop-types and type constants.

Most of these benefits are not unique to React and would apply to any project that uses TypeScript. Since TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, it can be used pretty much anywhere that you can use JavaScript.

Since JSX is just JavaScript, it is already in a great position to embrace the power of TypeScript. Not only that, TypeScript has first-class support for JSX in the compiler, types included! See [JSX vs. React Types](../tsx-files/jsx-vs-react-types.mdx) for more information on the differences between the JSX types provided by TypeScript vs. React.
