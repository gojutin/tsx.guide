### `forwardRef`

Imaging you wanted to create an `Input` component with some added props, but you wanted it to be treated just like a normal `input` element.
It should be able to accept any props that an `input` element can accept, and should be able to be assigned a ref that can be used to focus, blur, etc.

This is exactly where the `forwardRef` comes in.

Here is an example of a component that uses `forwardRef` to meet all of this criteria. The types are provided as type arguments to the generic `forwardRef` function.

```tsx {7}
type Props = React.InputHTMLAttributes<HTMLInputElement> & {
  myCustomProp?: boolean;
};

type Ref = HTMLInputElement;

export const Input = React.forwardRef<Ref, Props>((props, ref) => {
  const { myCustomProp, ...rest } = props;
  // Make sure myCustomProp is not spread into the input element.
  return <input ref={ref} {...rest} />;
});
```

Notice how the type arguments are passed in the order of `Ref`/`Props`, but the value arguments are provided back in the opposite order.

`forwardRef` is especially useful for component library authors where you are wrapping the instrinsic elements with styles or extra features.
